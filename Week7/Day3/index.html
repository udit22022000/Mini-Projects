          The client-server model describes how a server provides resources and
          services to one or more clients.In the client-server architecture,
          when the client computer sends a request for data to the server
          through the internet, the server accepts the requested process and
          deliver the data packets requested back to the client.Clients do not
          share any of their resources. Examples of Client-Server Model are
          Email, World Wide Web, etc.<br /><br />
          <b>How the Client-Server Model works ?</b><br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              User enters the URL(Uniform Resource Locator) of the website or
              file. The Browser then requests the DNS(DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM)
              Server.
            </li>
            <li>DNS Server lookup for the address of the WEB Server.</li>
            <li>DNS Server responds with the IP address of the WEB Server.</li>
            <li>
              Browser sends over an HTTP/HTTPS request to WEB Server’s IP
              (provided by DNS server).
            </li>
            <li>Server sends over the necessary files of the website.</li>
            <li>
              Browser then renders the files and the website is displayed. This
              rendering is done with the help of DOM (Document Object Model)
              interpreter, CSS interpreter and JS Engine collectively known as
              the JIT or (Just in Time) Compilers.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br /><b>Advantages of Client-Server model:</b><br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>Centralized system with all data in a single place.</li>
            <li>
              Cost efficient requires less maintenance cost and Data recovery is
              possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              The capacity of the Client and Servers can be changed separately.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br /><b>Disadvantages of Client-Server model:</b><br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Clients are prone to viruses, Trojans and worms if present in the
              Server or uploaded into the Server.
            </li>
            <li>Server are prone to Denial of Service (DOS) attacks.</li>
            <li>
              Data packets may be spoofed or modified during transmission.
            </li>
            <li>
              Phishing or capturing login credentials or other useful
              information of the user are common and MITM(Man in the Middle)
              attacks are common.

          A port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer, thus ranging from 0 to
          65535. For TCP, port number 0 is reserved and cannot be used, while
          for UDP, the source port is optional and a value of zero means no
          port. A process associates its input or output channels via an
          Internet socket, which is a type of file descriptor, associated with a
          transport protocol, an IP address, and a port number. This is known as
          binding. A socket is used by a process to send and receive data via
          the network. The operating system's networking software has the task
          of transmitting outgoing data from all application ports onto the
          network, and forwarding arriving network packets to processes by
          matching the packet's IP address and port number to a socket. For TCP,
          only one process may bind to a specific IP address and port
          combination. Common application failures, sometimes called port
          conflicts, occur when multiple programs attempt to use the same port
          number on the same IP address with the same protocol.

          <b>What is DNS?</b><br /><br />
          Domain Name Servers (DNS) is an amazing technology that helps us open
          internet addresses without a hustle. At its basic, DNS is the
          Internet’s equivalent of a phone book. They maintain a directory of
          domain names and translate them to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
          The way DNS works is just like the contacts section of your
          smartphone. Do you want John’s number? Just type the name and your
          phone will fetch it for you. Information received from all the domain
          name servers across the internet are stored together at the Central
          Registry. Host companies and Internet Service Providers are constantly
          in touch with the Central Registry to get the updated DNS information.
          <br /><br /><b>Main Function of DNS</b><br /><br />
          The primary function of DNS is name resolution. It’s an architecture
          that maps names to addresses so that when a user tries to access
          another computer on a network, it directs him there. For example, when
          you type in a web address, e.g., www.get.tech, your Internet Service
          Provider views the DNS associated with the domain name, translates it
          into a machine-friendly IP address (for example 215.178.254.70 is the
          IP for www.get.tech) and directs your Internet connection to the
          correct website.

        <div class="c2-details">
          HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information
          with an HTTP request or response. An HTTP header consists of its
          case-insensitive name followed by a colon (:), then by its value.
          Whitespace before the value is ignored.<br /><br />
          Custom proprietary headers have historically been used with an X-
          prefix, but this convention was deprecated in June 2012 because of the
          inconveniences it caused when nonstandard fields became standard in
          RFC 6648; others are listed in an IANA registry, whose original
          content was defined in RFC 4229. IANA also maintains a registry of
          proposed new HTTP headers.<br /><br />
          <b>Headers can be grouped according to their contexts:</b><br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              General headers apply to both requests and responses, but with no
              relation to the data transmitted in the body.
            </li>
            <li>
              Request headers contain more information about the resource to be
              fetched, or about the client requesting the resource.
            </li>
            <li>
              Response headers hold additional information about the response,
              like its location or about the server providing it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Entity headers contain information about the body of the resource,
              like its content length or MIME type.

        <div class="c2-details">
          The purpose of an origin server is to process and respond to incoming
          internet requests from internet clients. The concept of an origin
          server is typically used in conjunction with the concept of an edge
          server or caching server. At its core, an origin server is a computer
          running one or more programs that are designed to listen for and
          process incoming internet requests. An origin server can take on all
          the responsibility of serving up the content for an internet property
          such as a website, provided that the traffic does not extend beyond
          what the server is capable of processing and latency is not a primary
          concern. The physical distance between an origin server and a client
          making a request adds latency to the connection, increasing the time
          it takes for an internet resource such as a webpage to be loaded. The
          additional round-trip time (RTT) between client and origin server
          required for a secure internet connection using SSL/TLS also add
          additional latency to the request, directly impacting the experience
          of the client requesting data from the origin. By using a Content
          Distribution Network (CDN) round-trip time is able to be reduced, and
          the amount of requests to an origin server are also able to be
          reduced.

          Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an instrument that utilizes
          extra HTTP headers to advise browsers to give a web application
          running at one end, access to chosen assets from an alternate starting
          point. A web application executes a cross-starting point HTTP demand
          when it demands an asset that has alternate inception (space,
          convention, or port) from its own.
          <br /><br />
          CORS is a security policy that has been declared by W3C on how systems
          should communicate between different domains. These set of rules allow
          the client-server communication between the same domains & restricts
          cross-origin communications to a few techniques.

          While working with the REST APIs or web applications, we all might
          have come across certain errors in browser console namely, “request
          blocked by CORS policy” or “Access-Control-Allow-Origin”. These are
          called CORS errors and below is the elaborate explanation regarding
