          Context in JavaScript refers to the object within which the function
          being executed. this refers to the object that the function is
          executing in.<br /><br />
          The code provided above is getting executed inside the global object.

          Each and every line of the code that we write in javascript gets
          executed either in Global Execution Context or Functional Execution
          Context.<br />
          Refering to the above example, first and formost global execution gets
          created. When outer function will be called, it creates it's own
          functional execution context, within that it executes the code written
          inside that function. Within the execution context of outer function,
          a new functional execution for inner function is created and as the
          outer function returns it's value, outer function execution context
          gets scraped off from the memory.

          In simple words, it means the children scope has access to the
          variables defined in the parent scope. For instance, If I were to
          define a function and declare a variable inside it and inside the very
          same function, define another function, then I should be able to use
          that variable inside the inner function because of lexical scoping.
          <br />
          Refering to the above example, we can see that inner function has
          access to all the variables and functions that are within the scope of
          parent function of inner function.

          With the help of Hoisting, the variable and function declarations are
          moved to tht top of code even before the code being executed.
          <br />
          Refering to the above example, the first console.log statement will be
          producing Reference Error, because the name is not declared at all in
          the whole code. The second console.log statement will be producing
          undefined because due to hoisting age will be declared before
          execution, but value will be assigned to age variable after printing
          the value of age and for the last statement, email will get printed as
          it is, since email will get declared and defined before it gets
          printed.

          Currying in Javascript basically refers to process in which we
          transform a function with multiple arguments to a function with less
          number of arguments.
          <br />
          From the above code we can see that how a complex code(code with n
          arguments) can be broke into nested functions with x and (n-x)
          arguments respectively with the help of curying.
