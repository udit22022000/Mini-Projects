            <b>STEP 1:</b>
            First of all a global execution context is created. Thereafter
            starts the most initial phase called creation phase, in this phase
            all the variables and functions are declared in the Global Execution
            context.

            <b>STEP 2:</b>
            Now the Execution phase starts, where all variables are assigned
            values and lines are being executed one by one as encountered.

            <b>STEP 3:</b>
            As we can see that, in the last line of the code, a function
            sayHello is being called. So now a brand new functional execution
            context will be created, then there will be 2 phases of execution
            for that partcular function. The first phase will be creation phase,
            where all the variables inside it will be declared.

            <b>STEP 4:</b>
            Now the execution phase starts inside the functional execution
            context of sayHello function, where all the lines inside the
            function is executed one by one.
