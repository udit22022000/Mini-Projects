          Here, in each iteration, value of i gets printed and the function
          inside setTimeout function is being transferred to web api container
          and from the web api container that anonymous function is shifted to
          callback queue. For each iteration this process goes on, till the
          value of i becomes 20. As for-loop execution gets over and call stack
          becomes empty, now functions waiting inside the callback queue is
          taken out one by one, put into call stack and executed, here every
          function will be printing 20 because final value of i was 20.

          This case is slightly different from the previous one. As we know,
          ‘let’ is a block-scoped declaration and it will create a new variable
          binding for every iteration of the for loop. So in each iteration, a
          new variable with the updated value is being created in the memory.
          So, later on when functions are being executed after taking out of the
          callback queue, they will be printing that value of i, to which it is
          binded. So, here each function will be printing different value of i.
