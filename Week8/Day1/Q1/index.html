    <h3>PROTOTYPE</h3>
    <p>
      Prototypes in JavaScript is nothing but a special set of properties which
      an object holds. Almost everything in JavaScript is derived from Object.
      Each object holds it's own set of prototype properties.
    </p>
    <pre>
      var fooFunc = function() {
        return {
            foo: 42
        }
    };
    fooFunc.prototype.bar = 'baz';
    var fooVal = fooFunc();
    console.log(fooVal);   // {foo: 42}
    console.log(fooFunc.prototype);     // {bar: "baz", constructor: ƒ}
    </pre>
    <h3>__proto__</h3>
    <p>
      Whenever we create an instance of any class, the prototype of the class is
      created in object as well. we have to check it in __proto__ property. this
      property contains the prototype of it’s class
