            Firstly, for loop gets executed, and function residing inside
            setTimeOut is passed on to web API container as many times the loop
            runs. As soon as the i becomes 4 control comes outside the loop.

            API tranfers all the functions from Web api container to the
            callback queue after 0 seconds ,of function getting into the
            container.

            After the execution of whole code that is present in the main
            function and when the call stack becomes empty, the control shifts
            to the call back queue. Functions residing in the call back queue is
            taken out one by one and put into call stack and is executed. Since
            the final value of i was 4 ...so 4 gets printed 3 times since there
            were three functions inside call back queue.

            Javascript virtual machine scans through the whole code. Initially
            the first line of the code is put into call stack, then start
            variable is defined with the current time stamp. Thereafter
            setTimeout function is encountered and that chunk of code is put
            into web api container.
