            As the code starts executing, fireCount and start variable gets
            defined. After that timer function is put into web api container,
            from there it is tranferred to callback queue. After the call stack
            becomes empty, timer function is taken out, and it is being executed
            till the if condition becomes true, when the duration becomes more
            than 1 sec, clearinterval gets executed , which leads to stop
            execution of the timer function, and finlly firecount is printed to
            the console.
