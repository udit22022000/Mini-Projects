            <b>STEP 1:</b>
            In the step 1, javascript virtual machine scans through the whole
            code. Each and every line is initially put into a call stack and is
            executed and then thrown out of the stack.During the execution when
            any web api triggering function is encountered, that chunk of the
            code is thrown into WEB API container.

            <b>STEP 2:</b>
            Api does it's work and after that the code is transferred from api
            container to callback Queue.

            <b>STEP 3:</b>
            After the execution of whole code that is present in the main
            function and when the call stack becomes empty, the control shifts
            to the call back queue. Functions residing in the call back queue is
            taken out one by one and put into call stack and is executed.
